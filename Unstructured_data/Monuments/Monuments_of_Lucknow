Bara Imambara, built by Nawab of Awadh Asaf-ud-Daula, is one of the most important historical monuments in Lucknow. The Imambara complex consists of a baoli (stepwell) and a bhool bhulaiyya, a labyrinth with interconnected doorways. There are over 1024 ways to reach the terrace but only two ways to come back down. 
The pride and joy of a historical city that captivates the hearts of people near and far, Bara Imambara is a testament to the time and one of the top tourist destinations of Lucknow.
One of the most well-known buildings in the city is the Lucknow Bara Imambara. It is one of the most beautiful examples of Mughal architecture and a rightful triumph and ode to engineering.
Winding and a bizarre labyrinth of narrow passageways running through the upper floor of the monument are the true showstoppers. It is also known as the Bhool Bhulaiya passage.
This Bara Imambara is second in size only to the Nizamat Imambara.
The Bara Imambara was constructed using Gothic, Rajput, and Mughal architectural elements. It was created by one of the most respected architects, Hafiz Kifayat Ullah, and is an example of pure engineering brilliance beyond comparison.
It is one of the last prominent projects that does not employ iron or other European design components.
There are 9 halls inside the monument, with the largest being the central hall.
It is one of the largest arched structures in the world, measuring 50 X 16 meters and standing over 15 meters tall with no beams supporting the ceiling.
Its construction is distinctive because it contains no woodwork other than what is found in the galleries. The roof is supported only by the interlocking bricks used to assemble the blocks and stands erect without any pillars.
The Imamabara is made of Lakhauri bricks and is decorated with stucco work, chattris, and parapets. This Imambara is distinctive because its roof is constructed with rice husk ash.
Bara Imambara is locally famous for its amazing maze, also called Bhool Bhulaiya. The topmost floor of the monument's structure is filled with an alluring maze of little tunnels that eventually leads to the rooftop.
There are 1024 ways to enter the maze, but only two methods to exit it. One may have a comprehensive perspective of the city from the roof.
The construction of this magnificent structure was started in the year 1784 by Nawab Asaf-Ud-Daula, the fourth Nawab of Awadh. It took more than 14 years to finish. Bara Imambara's remarkable history captivates the attention of all tourists visiting this fascinating location.
The masterpiece results from Nawab's love and devotion for his people. When the Awadh region was severely affected by a disaster, increasing employment was the purpose of erecting this monument.
A catastrophic famine that hit the Awadh Estate in the 18th century prompted the Nawab to devise a strategy to feed his starving subjects. He decided to require them to build great structures, which would then give them work and, consequently, food.
More than 20,000 peopleâ€”rich, poor, and eliteâ€”were employed by Asaf-ud-relief Daula's effort, which took 11 years to completeâ€”exactly how long the famine lasted.
The working class and poor started the project in the morning, and all of the construction was destroyed in the evening by the upper class.
Every one was guaranteed to work and support themselves until conditions returned to normal in 1791.
