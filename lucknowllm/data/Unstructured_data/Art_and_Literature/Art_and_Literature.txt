With tourists avoiding New Delhi because of the harmful air quality and smog, Lucknow, just over an hour’s flight from the capital, is a great alternative, offering a rich mix of architecture, craft and culinary heritage.

The capital of the state of Uttar Pradesh, on the banks of the River Gomti, Lucknow has been ruled by the Mughals, the Nawabs of Awadh, and the British through the ages, and its history remains visible in its buildings, arts and cuisine.

When Asaf-ud-Daula, the fourth Nawab of Awadh (state rulers of the area now known as Uttar Pradesh), shifted the state capital from Faizabad to Lucknow in 1775, it led to a cultural renaissance. An exodus of architects and craftsmen landed there from Delhi, and many other poets, artists and learned men from all around made Lucknow their home. It is said that artisans from as far as the Uzbekistan capital Tashkent, and masons from Isfahan in Iran, were brought to Lucknow by the Persian Nawabs.
One of the important crafts of Uttar Pradesh is Chikankari, which entails delicate and traditional hand embroidery. This form of handicrafts is mainly practiced in Lucknow. It is done on fabrics like chiffon, muslin, organza, organdie and silk. Chikan saris and Kurtas which are the perfect summer wear.

A melting pot of art, culture, cuisine and architecture, the bustling city of Lucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh, preserves its essence of grandeur in its kaleidoscopic experiences. From a vibrant culinary scene and exquisite historical monuments to its rich art and culture and vestiges of colonial charm, the city of nawabs, as it is popularly called, is as welcoming as is the warmth of its people.
Chikankari
A delicate hand embroidery technique done on fabrics like chiffon, muslin, organza, organdie and silk, chikankari is one of the most important crafts in Lucknow. The word 'chikan' means embroidery, and this form of art incorporates 36 different stitching techniques. In the beginning, only white yarn or muslin cloth was used. Stitching is done on the back of the cloth whereas the design is made on the front by tiny, running stitches. There are three main types of stitches – flat, embossed, and jaali (net effect). Due to a Persian influence, flowers have a permanent place in this art form. Typical chikankari motifs include creepers and vines. However, the types and styles in which these flowers are made keep varying with fashion trends. Today, there are hundreds of retailers of chikankari fabric across the country. In Lucknow, the lanes of markets are dotted with shops selling chikan work in various forms. You can pick up shirts, kurtas, bedsheets, table cloth, pillow covers and many other items adorned in chikankari. 

The technique is supposed to have been introduced by Mughal empress, Nur Jahan, in the 17th century.  Another legend speaks of a thirsty traveller, who stopped at a village in Lucknow, and requested a villager for water. Humbled by the villager’s hospitality and generosity, he imparted the skill of chikankari to him as an act of gratitude. 
Zardozi
This signature embroidery art of Lucknow has been around for centuries and has been been accorded a Geographical Indication tag (GI). Lucknow is the primary centre for zardozi, and apparels featuring this embroidery can be found in well-known shops of Chowk area, as well as other bazaars in the city. In Persian, 'zardozi' means gold embroidery. 

The original process, which is known as “Kalabatun”, made use of silk threads wrapped in real gold or silver; the thread was subsequently sewn onto different fabrics, and then embellished with gold threads, spangles, seed pearls, wires, beads, sequins etc. In the times of the nawabs, zardozi was used to decorate tapestries and wall hangings. Even elephants and horses were covered with heavy cloths adorned with zardozi. In that era, this form of embroidery was considered a luxury, since it could only be done on heavier fabrics like velvet, satin and silk. Therefore, only the royalty could afford it. It was regarded as a symbol of opulence. 
Perfumes/Attar
The city of Lucknow is known for its fine perfumes that are available in beautiful bottles of cut-glass work. Perfumers in Lucknow make delicate and lasting fragrances using various aromatic herbs, spices, sandal oil, musk, essence of flowers, and leaves. Attar, derived from Persian word 'atr' means fragrance. Perfumes or attars have been in use in Lucknow since the 19th century. During the days of the nawabs, perfumes were also added to food to enhance the taste and aroma of the dish. It is said that Mughal empress, Nur Jahan, would bathe in water perfumed by rose water, thus encouraging people to start extracting scented oil from the flower. 

Legend has it that the practice of using natural substances to derive scents came from ascetics who would burn roots and other plant material during their meditative bonfires. The sweet smells lingered for a while, inspiring nearby villagers to experiment with flowers to find the right tones. Once they had attars down to a science, the villagers started presenting these fragrances to the nawabs, who would spray the halls and walkways of the palaces before the arrival of guests. Since attar also has therapeutic properties, when sprayed in public spaces, it would subtly put visitors at ease.  
Surrounded by terraced lawns and gardens, the Residency, overlooking River Gomti, is one of the oldest buildings in the city. Originally, it was built as a large complex of residential quarters, armoury, stables, dispensaries, worship places, for the British General, a representative of the British East India Company, during the rule of Nawab Saadat Ali Khan between 1780 and 1800. Today, the ruins of the building reflect its former glory and allow one to soak in its colonial charm while visiting. The Baillie guard gate, named after Residency’s first resident, Col John Baillie, gives you a glimpse of the architecture and design you will see inside. The treasury, which was completely destroyed during the sepoy mutiny of 1857, and a marble plaque honouring the brave soldiers of that time, are the two structures you will see as you walk towards the main buildings. The banquet hall, still bearing intricate carvings and featuring high ceilings, with a pretty fountain in the centre, will transport you back to the time of grand ballroom dances and opulent parties. Opposite the hall stands Dr Fayrer’s (resident surgeon) house, used as a shelter for the British during the mutiny, as well as a makeshift hospital.

Translating to martyrs' memorial, Shaheed Smarak is a white marble structure standing amidst a beautiful park. It was built in 1970 by the Lucknow Development Authority on the banks of River Gomti opposite the Residency, in order to commemorate hundreds of soldiers who lost their lives during the 1857 freedom movement of India. The monument was designed and conceptualised by celebrated architect Prasanna Kothari, and emulates the style of Amar Jawan Jyoti, located at the India Gate in New Delhi, which also pays tribute to the thousands of jawaans who gave up their lives for the security of the nation. You can pay your respect to those who sacrificed their lives for the country, and spend some time exploring the vast grounds while stealing a moment of peace and serenity. 
Charbagh Railway Station, one of the two main railway stations in Lucknow, is an architectural marvel that features the best of Rajasthani and Mughal styles, mixed with British influences. The station appears like a chessboard from the sky, with turrets and domes resembling chess pieces. From the front however, it resembles a Rajput palace. Such is the ingenuity of the construction that large water reservoirs are beautifully hidden inside the building. Charbagh was designed by JH Horniman, an Englishman, in 1914. 

Bara Imambara is perhaps the most recognisable and popular symbol of Lucknow, and is visited by thousands of tourists all year round. 

Built as a relief project to provide work to the people of Awadh during a famine, the Bara Imambara was constructed by Nawab Asaf-ud-Daula during the 18th century, and its name essentially translates to a big place of worship. Its architecture, with delicate arches and jharokhas (windows), boasts Rajput, Mughal and Gothic influences. 

There are two main entrances to the Imambara, both guarded by enormous gateways. The ceiling of its central hall is said to have used interlocking bricks without any beams or pillars for support. The structure has an amazing maze of corridors called 'bhul bhulaiya'. It has a network of more than 1,000 labyrinthine passages with some leading to entrance or exit points and others heading to deadends. There are also 489 doorways standing at the mouths of confusing, twisting paths. The grave of the nawab is located under a canopy. At one time, there was a mile-long tunnel underground running to River Gomti that added mysticism to the location. 

Surrounding the main edifice are lush, well-maintained gardens that are perfect for a leisurely stroll, or for just relaxing and soaking in the splendour of the Bara Imambara.

Lucknow is full of stellar examples of Nawabi architecture, but there are few that compare to the Chhota Imambara, built by Nawab Muhammad Ali Shah in 1838. The Nawab’s mausoleum, as well as his mother’s, are present here.

The complex comprises of the tomb of Princess Zinat Algiya, the daughter of the king of Awadh, a watchtower known as Satkhanda, a ceremonial gateway called Naubat Khana, and the Husainabad mosque. The Chhota Imambara boasts a gilded dome, several turrets and beautiful chandeliers. It comprises five doorways and Islamic verses have been carved into its exterior walls. There are two main halls, namely Shenasheen and Azakhana. The latter is embellished with gilt-edged mirrors and colourful stuccos, as well as exquisite chandeliers that are said to have been brought from Belgium. It is because of these lamps and crystal chandeliers that this iconic building is also known as the palace of lights. 

The Imambara stands to the west of the Bara Imambara, with the exterior of the building boasting a golden dome with fine calligraphy. It is at its finest during festivals and other special occasions, when the whole structure is lit up and glimmers like a jewel.

Shahnajaf Imambara is a white-domed mausoleum constructed by Nawaz Ghazi-ud-din Haider at Paltan Ghat. He was the last wazir (minister) and the first king of the state of Awadh in 1816-1817, and has been buried at Shahnajaf, which is why this Imambara is also known as Karbala. His wives, Mubarak Mahal, Sarfaraz Mahal and Mumtaz Mahal, are also buried here. The Imambara was a tribute and symbol of his devotion to Caliph Hazrat Ali, the husband of Fatima, who is said to be the favourite daughter of Prophet Mohammed.

This Saturn-shaped building is situated at Surajkund Park and is a major attraction of the city. The planetarium boasts a state-of-the-art projection system that is renowned for special effects that thrill children and adults alike. A must-watch is the Cosmic Journey show, which dives into the Chandrayaan mission to the Moon, provides an explanation as to why Pluto has been removed from the solar system, and even showcases different galactic structures and various nebulae. It is also known for its art projecting system, digital sound and lift-ramp for the specially-abled. 

The Indira Gandhi Planetarium is especially crowded on the weekends and during the summer holidays, when children from all over Uttar Pradesh come to see the galaxy come alive before their eyes. The first show on Saturday and Sunday is in English, while the rest of the shows are conducted in Hindi. There is a nominal entry fee, which is waived for the specially-abled. 

The foundation stone of the planetarium was laid in 1988. The goals of this initiative were to popularise science and the study of astronomy among the youth of the state through quizzes, interactive sessions, exhibitions and competitions. 

The state capital is becoming a hub of Hindi literature, feel several littérateurs, poets and writers. They say that’s the reason why more and more activities celebrating Hindi literature are being organised in the city. However, some caution that absence of money for writers, thinkers and poets could hurt the prospects of Hindi literature in Lucknow.

In this era when people prefer reading books on the internet, Lucknow writers are coming out with more and more books in Hindi on a variety of subjects,” said poet and Hindi literature critic Sarvesh Asthana.

“Books of four eminent comic poets will be released at the same event at the Sangeet Natak Akademi here on ‘Hindi Diwas’. These include Mukul Mahan’s ‘Yamlok Mein Ghotala’, Rajendra Pandit’s ‘Pandit Ji’, Pankaj Prasoon’s ‘Lampatganj’ and my book ‘Wo Balkani Wali’. All will be released by deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma in the presence of former president of Hindi Sansthan Dr Udai Pratap Singh and eminent writer Dr Gopal Chaturvedi. I think its will be a one-of-its-kind occasion.”
