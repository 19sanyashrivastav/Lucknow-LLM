//"RUMI DARWAZA"//

Rumi Darwaza is one of the oldest and most famous structures of the city.
At first glance, the unassuming daily crowds and the occasional roadblocks shroud the true significance of this iconic building.
But it stands, strong and ever-so imposing, beating the test of time and modernisation. This majestic gateway speaks volumes of the heritage and ancestry of the locale.
In every sense of the word, Rumi Darwaza is a gateway to Old Lucknow.
The history of Rumi Darwaza, Lucknow dates back 238 years when it was built in 1784, at the behest of the then Nawab of Awadh - Asaf-ud-Daula. 
Following the death of his father in 1775, he became the nawab at the young age of 26. Raised under the shadow of his mother and grandmother, 
the famous Begums of Oudh who amassed wealth and administrative power with the help of the British, Asaf-ud-Daula wanted to break away and build his own empire. 
Lucknow was, at that time, just a small town.

//"NAWAB WAJID ALI SHAH ZOOLOGICAL GARDEN"//

This zoological park was established on November 29, 1921 to commemorate the arrival of the Prince of Wales to Lucknow.
Its establishment was conceived by the then Governor Sir Harcourt Butler. The complex was established in the 18th century by Nawab Nasiruddin Haider, 
the then Nawab of Awadh as a mango orchard. At that time it was known as Banarasi Bagh. Even today, in the colloquial language, the locals call it Banarasi Bagh.
In the evening by the Nawabs, as the evening of Awadh used to be famous, a Baradari was built to sit here, which is still situated in the middle of the zoological 
garden with all its grandeur and dignity.
