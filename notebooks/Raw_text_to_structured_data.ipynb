The temple is actually dedicated to Lord Balaji, the manifestation of Vishnu which is mostly worshipped in the southern states of India. The temple, as well as the shrine, is built in traditional Dravidian architecture and design and there is also a magnificent 50 feet high pyramidal entrance, which is seen in almost the temple of South India. Some simply come here to witness the elaborately carved gopuram if they cannot go inside. The huge temple complex is about 27,000 in area and apart from Lord Venkateshwar, there are also shrines which are dedicated to Lord Hanuman, Goddess Padmavati and the Navagraha or the nine planets. Naturally, the temple records a high footfall every day. The temple is open from 6 am to 8 pm in summers and 7 am to 7 pm in winters.\n",
        "This stunning temple is located in the banks of the Gomti River at Khantwara and this is a very quiet place in the outskirts of the busy city of Lucknow. The devotees come here mostly to pray in the peace and quiet of the temple complex. It is said that the temple was established by Rajkumar Chandraketu, who was the son of Lord Laxman. He had built the temple in honor of Goddess Chandrika, who was a manifestation of Goddess Parvati. You will first set your eyes on a beautiful idol of Lord Shiva seated in the middle of a water pool. The maximum footfall in the temple is recorded during new moon nights, when offerings are made to the Goddess, and during the nine nights of Navaratri. A fair is organized at that time and devotees come from far and wide. The temple remains open from 5 am to 1 pm and then from 2 pm to 11 pm.\"\"\"\n"
